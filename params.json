{"name":"Realstate-data-analysis","tagline":"","body":"# Realstate-Data-Analysis\r\nThis the the readme file\r\n\r\n###Background\r\nData consists of 57258 real state properties from the states of Arizona, Alaska, Oregon, California, New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico. But only 11 listings are out of Arizona state, and therefore excluded. The data used are all listings in Arizona.\r\nData comes with 15 variables in total. Variables describes information about the listings such as Geo location, list price, closing price, number of bedroom, house size and etc.,\r\n\r\n###Goal\r\nThe goal is to predict the closing prices of properties, using all information from the data set and from external data sources, and answering the following questions.\r\n\r\n###Data Cleaning & Methodologies\r\n•\tComments variable is eliminated for now\r\n•\tListings have no \"ClosePrice\" data, but with listing status as \"Closed\" are excluded.\r\n•\tListings of non \"Mobile housing\", but with price \"< 30000\" are excluded.\r\n•\tListings with 100+ bathrooms are converted to maximum number 25 bathrooms\r\n•\tNew variable: \"Price_diff\": value of closing price minus listing price\r\n•\tNew variable \"duration\": length of time a listing has been posted\r\n•\tNew variable \"neighbour\": clustering results\r\n•\tNew variable \"others\": factor variable of \"Unusually big, expensive\" houses and \"normal\" houses\r\n•\tClustering: Use kmeans method on Latitude and Longitude to divide the data into 70 clusters(cities). 70 was determined by MLE on the main model in a separate file.\r\n•\tCross validation: 80% of listings are randomly chosen proportionally to their cluster size as \"train data set\"; 20% are chosen to be the \"test data set\"\r\n•\tRepetition: Cross validation process is taken 1000 times, the final results will be taken by the average of them.\r\n•\tInteractive effects: Interactive effects of key variables are well considered.\r\n\r\n###Versions of the analysis\r\nVersion 1: Using the existing data to build the predictive model, without variable \"list price\" \r\nVersion 2: Using the existing data to build the predictive model, with variable \"list price\" \r\nVersion 3: Importing external data sources\r\n•\tActual GIS information of neizbourghoods, Cities in Arizona state, and accurately assign listings to its location\r\n•\tIdentify locations of Supermarket, malls, schools, hospitals and etc., calculated average distance of a house to its nearest stores.\r\n•\tMortgage interest rate associated with properties' listed time'\r\n•\t... \r\nVersion 4: Ideal data set will include Years of the house; number of garages; decoration cost; buyer's payment method and etc.,\r\n\r\n###Conclusions\r\nVersion 1 conclusion: The average difference between predicted closing price and real closing price is very close to 0, suggesting the predictive model is a good predictive model with current information; however the average of absolute difference is around $35000, either it's smaller or bigger, suggesting other unknown factors are causing the difference.\r\nVersion 2 conclusion: The additional information contained in \"list price\" almost make the estimation perfectly. Suggesting there are more significant variables, other than current 15, affecting the the prices.\r\nVersion 3 conclusion: (To be continued)\r\n\r\n###Support or Contact\r\nYou can contact me through My [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khairi-yi-4966a062?)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
